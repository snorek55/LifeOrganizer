## General info

This project is a desktop program to save, classify, rate, etc. any kind of collection. It is a personal project but I hope it might be useful for other people as well.

For example, we have MovOrg addin (first addin developed). This allows you to save all kinds of movies and see all the information about them. You can check actors, budget, director, writers. You can also check out what other movies have that director produced, etc.All the information for movies is extracted from IMDb API and other sources and then saved into your own database. For that, you must provide a valid API key.
You can also add your own ratings, mark them as watched or as must watched, etc.

This will also be done for collections like games, fitness (exercises), food and books but, for now, this is a very young project, I do not have much time and this is my first big programming project.

Any help of any kind will be appreciated.
